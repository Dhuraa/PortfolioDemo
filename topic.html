        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p>
          Ever since I was a child, I was a foodie ! Everytime i ate outside, I always get curious as to how its made,
          and to replicate it ! And hence my love for cooking started ! I find it as a great way to explore cultures.
          Trying new foods from different cultures can lead you to find new favorite dishes, but it can also lead you to
          a deeper appreciation of the culture and the people. You can expand your horizons and taste the world from the
          comfort of your own kitchen. I believe cooking is a versatile hobby. You can listen to music and dance around
          your kitchen as you prepare dinner. You can spend quality time with others while cooking, too. For me cooking
          is a type of meditation and I get great satisfaction from cooking tatsy food !

        <h3>Reading Books</h3>
        <p>
          I love reading books, and have been reading since quite a young age.
          I belive reading is a form of escape and you can experience all forms of emotions,
          and adventure sitting from the comfort of your house! Reading not only imrpoves language abilities,
          but also increases imagination skills and also depending upon context and genre you can actually learn
          some useful things or atleast life lessons ! Personally my favorite genre is young adult, thriller and
          classics ! Some people that young adult book are just for kids, but for me, I love their stories and yes they
          can be motivating ! The best example would be Harry Potter ! Anyways I enjoy reviweing books for fun and have
          started youtube recently, and you can find one video below!
